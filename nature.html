                            The most fascinating aspect about travelling is how much you learn.

                            increasingly more experiences, you start to see that things are not as simple as they may seem at

                            In 2017, I decided to pack my bags and take off on a year’s long journey around the world on my own. 
                            At the time, I was in my second year of university and still had exams to prepare for, but I knew 
                            I needed a break to freshen up my mind and try to see the world in a different way. 
                            It sounds cheesy, but I wanted, or needed, to see the world before I was ‘taught everything’ 
                            in lectures and textbooks. I had thought of travelling before starting university, but circumstances 
                            meant I didn’t have a choice at that time, so instead I went when I needed to. After getting the results 
                            from that year’s exams, I started planning my route on a map. I knew I wanted to get a Round-the-world ticket, 
                            which allows you to travel in one general direction. I used the now defunct British agency STA Travel to help 
                            me plan the trip and select what countries would be important for my experience and I went from the UK westwards, 
                            travelling through 13 countries.

                <p>In 2017, I decided to pack my bags and take off on a year’s long journey around the world on my own.

                    3. How did this particular experience make you who you are today?
                </h3>
                <p>Travelling opened up doors I didn’t know existed. It made me a much more sociable person without 
                    actually changing who I am and what my values are. It forced me to learn how to talk to people and 
                    how to integrate into new and sometimes daunting social situations. There are things that cannot be 
                    taught but are acquired through experiential learning, and meeting new people is definitely a skill 
                    that is difficult to get as an introvert.

                    4. What tips would you give to our new aspiring world travellers? 
                </h3>
                <p>My best piece of advice for people who have never really travelled before, especially on their own, is to try new things. 
                    Not stupid things, but try experiences you are not comfortable doing at home. Be adventurous, be bold. I wrote a blog and 
                    described my feelings and thoughts, not just about the places I was visiting but also about my mindset. I went on long 
                    multi-day hikes on my own and saw things so few people get to see that I can hardly believe myself. 
                    I spoke to locals and asked them their favourite things to do in an area and most people don’t do that when they travel. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    5. Are there any places in particular you would place on the must see list for the new travellers? 
                </h3>
                <p>A must-see list is hard to put together as different people like different things. But some of the most stunning experiences 
                    I have had come back to nature, like the huge glaciers and mountain-scapes of Argentina; the long lost civilisations of Peru 
                    in Machu Picchu and the Hobbiton movie set of New Zealand. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    6. Having seen your blog, you've clearly fallen in love with nature photography. How did it all start? 
                </h3>
                <p>My love for photography began as my trip did. I thought it would be a good idea to document my journey, not 
                    necessarily for sharing with people, but as a means to express what I was feeling at the time. It took a long 
                    time to really develop my skills, but I spent lots of effort reading about the craft while on bus rides, plane 
                    journeys and experimented lots with my camera. To give you an idea, I took around 30,000 photos on my 9 month trip, 
                    of which maybe 100 are good enough to share. Taking on photography made me look at ordinary things in new ways; looking 
                    for new angles and understanding how lighting affects the whole mood of the photo really reflects what my trip symbolised. 
                    I was beginning to see the world in a more raw and genuine light. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    7. Is there any place in particular you'd like to return to or any other place you'd like to see? 
                </h3>
                <p>I went to lots of places on my trip and they were all absolutely wonderful that I would recommend to anyone willing to 
                    travel and go off the beaten track. But the world is a big place and I think I’d like to go explore new cultures and 
                    places before returning to some of the places I saw on my trip. This isn’t to say I wouldn’t go back if I had the 
                    chance to, but I’d rather plan for places my eyes haven’t seen yet. For instance, I would love to go explore the ‘Silk 
                    Road’ countries in central Asia. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    8. On a slightly more pressing issue though, what would you say about climate change and how can travellers 
                    explore the world in a more sustainable way? I'd add useful itinerary or accommodation...through links to 
                    your website if need be. 
                </h3>
                <p>Climate change is a real and pressing issue in today’s world. It’s beginning to impact people in their 
                    everyday lives in small but noticeable ways, such as increased severity and frequency of storms. We often 
                    feel disconnected from the effects of climate change because we don’t necessarily believe in things we can’t 
                    see for ourselves. But take a trip to some of world’s famous glaciers like in Patagonia, or Franz Joseph 
                    glacier in New Zealand, and you’ll very clearly see how the temperature trends have eroded one of the greatest 
                    sources of fresh water on earth. It’s terrifying to see that such gigantic structures can be affected by 
                    temperature changes of ±1ºC. My advice for travelling in a more sustainable way would be reduce our footprint 
                    everywhere we go. Obviously, it’s hard to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly half way across the world, 
                    but in making small changes like eating less meat, shopping for items without plastic, travelling in public 
                    transport; you can contribute in a massive way to a positive change for the future of our world. </p>
