 # Yūgen

Welcome to [Yūgen](https://8000-aquamarine-woodpecker-p6r7i0xp.ws-eu07.gitpod.io/index.html). 

[Yūgen](https://8000-aquamarine-woodpecker-p6r7i0xp.ws-eu07.gitpod.io/index.html) is a Japanese word that refers to an awareness of the Universe that triggers emotional responses too deep and powerful for words. It is used as a title for this website with the aim to inspire nature travellers to embrace the natural world and raise awareness about the need to protect the natural environment. As such, this website will be targeted towards people who want to travel sustainably while contributing positively to the global goal of protecting the environment. In other word, [Yugen](https://8000-aquamarine-woodpecker-p6r7i0xp.ws-eu07.gitpod.io/index.html)  is a platform for like-minded travellers who want to do more to help the environment than just visiting places. 

Users can get inspiration from Sir David Attenborough through his plea to "do more in order to protect our planet." Users can also find and get in touch with other nature travellers featured in [Yugen](https://8000-aquamarine-woodpecker-p6r7i0xp.ws-eu07.gitpod.io/index.html)'s Discover Nature page. On each page, there is a call to action that takes users to a sign up area and be part of the community of passionate travellers who care about the environment.  

## Features

This website follows a "three clicks" where three pages are provided with two call to action buttons at the bottom of the homepage and Discover Nature page (second page) which direct the users to the sign up area to be part of the global community of passionate travellers.

### Existing Features
