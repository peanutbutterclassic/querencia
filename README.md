[Yūgen](https://peanutbutterclassic.github.io/yugen/) is a Japanese word which refers to an awareness of the Universe that triggers emotional responses too deep and powerful for words. It is used as a title for this website with the aim to inspire nature travellers to embrace the natural world and raise awareness about the need to protect the environment. As such, this website will be targeted towards people who want to travel sustainably while contributing positively to the global goal of protecting the environment. In other word, [Yugen](https://peanutbutterclassic.github.io/yugen/) is a platform for like-minded travellers who want to do more to help the environment than just visiting places. 

Users can get inspiration from Sir David Attenborough through his plea to "do more in order to protect our planet." Users can also find and get in touch with other nature travellers featured in [Yugen](https://peanutbutterclassic.github.io/yugen/)'s Discover Nature page. On each page, there is a call to action that takes users to a sign up area and be part of the community of passionate travellers who care about the environment.  

## Features

This website follows a "three clicks" rule where three pages are provided with two call to action buttons at the bottom of the homepage and Discover Nature page (second page) which direct the users to the sign up area to be part of [Yugen](https://peanutbutterclassic.github.io/yugen/)'s global community of passionate travellers.

### Existing Features

  * The full responsive navigation bar (created using Bootstrap) includes menu tabs with links the Home page (including link on the logo to navigate back to the homepage), Discover Nature page, Interview page and form page.

* The landing page (home) image
  * The landing includes a photograph of nature (height 600px) with text overlay "Discover, Dream, Explore" to inspire users to get their foot into the world of discoveries.
  * This section introduces the technique gained from one of [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)'s lectures on website animations to create a zoom effect upon entering the website to grab users' attention.

This website aims to achieve the following goals:
* Inspire people to see their surroundings as well as what goes on beyond their borders and document what they see or witness;
* Raise awareness about environmental degration and the need to protect the planet from further harm;
* Create a network of like-minded individuals with a passion for nature and travelling; and,
* Get people to join the community and become future nature gardians.

Users can expect:
* Gain an understanding of the need to team-up and work to protect the planet;
* Have the opportunity to do something good for the planet through travelling, exploring and learning; and,
* Get advise on how to make a difference. 

## UX

Users' experience and take aways:
* [Yugen](https://peanutbutterclassic.github.io/yugen/)'s primary goal is to encourage people to travel, discover and learn more about this wonderful world;
* Secondly, [Yugen](https://peanutbutterclassic.github.io/yugen/) aims to help users realise that they have a responsibility as well as the ability to help protect nature by simply take action;
* Lastly, [Yugen](https://peanutbutterclassic.github.io/yugen/) hopes to create a platform where like-minded nature travellers can take action to protect the environment.

In order to achieve the abovementioned UX goals, [Yugen](https://peanutbutterclassic.github.io/yugen/) shall have the following:
* An easy to use website that provides a sense of urgency and the need to take action to protect the planet;
* A powerful message that bring like-minded people together to achieve a common goal; and,
* A call to action with a sense of urgency.
 
Users' stories:
1. As a new visitor, I want to know why travelling and nature are good for me.
2. As a frequent traveller, I want to know how to maximise my travel experience and how to help improve the environmental condition of the places I visit rather than see these places being neglected.
3. As an eager environmental guardian, I want to better understand responsible travelling.
4. As a returning visitor, I want to know what I can do to help.

## Scope

To achieve the strategic goals, I have adopted a three-click rule, which is implemented as follows:
* An attractive logo is placed top left hand side of the browser to catch the users' attention with colours representing Summer, Autumm and Spring (the colours of life).
* Users are lured to the main picture of a discoverer walking across an iconic [Wharariki Beach](https://www.newzealand.com/int/feature/wharariki-beach/) in New Zealand during sunset.
* The users are presented with a video of Sir David Attenborough who would speak passionately about the need to protect our environment, which is followed by the three simple steps to get involved urging users do more to help the planet.
* A button is strategically placed with a bright colour to attact user's attention and trigger their curiosity. The button "discover more" takes users to the next page, a Discover Nature page.
* The Discover Nature page is designed to englighten users about nature discoveries through Yugen.
* Users would follow the story until another button appears at the bottom which takes them to the next page to meet Yugen's Photographer and Globetrotter who is also a fine Mechanical Engineer at a tender age of barely 22 when he sets off on the around the world trip. 
* A travel video in Hawaii to inspire users to get out more during the post pandemic.
* A final call to action button (third button) appears and the bottom of the page to direct users to the sign up page.
